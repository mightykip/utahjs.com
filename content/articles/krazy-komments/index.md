If your article has assets, create a folder like this one and stick them there, and name the article index.

this is a separate paragraph
this is not

  * l;kj;lkj
  * lkj;ljk
  
     this is code

  1. lkjklj;klj

Code Blocks
-----------

Include code blocks like this:

<%= code '01.js' %>

The path is relative to the article's folder.

Images
------

Place your image in the article's directory and ...

<%= img 'burger.png' %>

Or just get the image path if you need to do something fancier:

<%= img_path 'burger.png' %>
